  **Scalars** are physical quantities with magnitudes only.

<Callout type="definition" title="Vector">
  **Vectors** are physical quantites with both magnitudes and directions.

### **1.3.1.1 Vectors in 1D**

Vectors in 1D can be added or substracted via two methods.

1. -Using vector diagram or

2. -Using simple addition or substraction

In 1D, the directions of the vectors are limited to either forward or backward,
we can actually add or substract them just like how we add or substract scalar quantities with
the help of **sign convention**.

By adopting a sign convention, we take one direction as positive and the other as negative.

### **1.3.1.2 Vectors in 2D**

Vectors in 1D can be added or substracted via three methods

1. -Parallelogram method

<br />

<VectorAdditionSimulationParallelogram />

<br />

2. -Head to Tail method

   <br />

   <VectorAdditionSimulationHeadToTail />

   <br />

3. -Component method.

The vectors are resolved into two perpendicular directions and then added.
**This is method is extremely importantly because it is the most convenient method to add
three or more vectors.**
