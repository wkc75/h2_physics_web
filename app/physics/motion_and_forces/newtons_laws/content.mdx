### **Intertia**

<InlineCitation

  content="show an understanding that mass is the property of a body which resists change in motion (inertia)."

<Callout type="definition" title="Intertia">

    Intertia of an object is the resistance of the object to change its state of motion due to **mass**.

## **Newton's 1st Law**

<Callout type="definition" title="Statement of Newton's 1st Law of Motion">
  A body stays at rest or continues to move with a constant speed in a straight
  line unless acted upon by a **net external force**.
</Callout>

## **Linear Momentum, $p$**

<InlineCitation
  label="3g"
  content="define and use linear momentum as the product of mass and velocity."
/>

<Callout type="definition" title="Definition of Linear Momentum">
The linear momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity.

$$
p = mv
$$

The unit of $p$ is $kg \, m \, s^{-1}$ or $N\,s$.

# **3.2.2 Newton's Second Law of Motion**

<Callout type="definition" title="Statement of Newton's 2nd Law of Motion">
  The **rate of change of linear momentum** of a body is **directly
  proportional** to the **resultant force** acting on it and is in the direction
  of the resultant force.
</Callout>

<InlineCitation
label="3i"
content="recall the relationship resultant force F = ma, for a body of constant mass, and use this to solve problems."
/>
<Callout type="advanced" title="Derivation of  F = ma">
From Newton's 2nd law of motion,

$$
F_{net} \propto \frac{dp}
{dt}
$$

and thus

$$

F_{net} = k \frac{dp}{dt}


$$

In this case, $k=1$. Thus

$$

F_{net} =  \frac{dp}{dt}


$$

$$

F_{net} =  \frac{dmv}{dt}


$$

**If the object has constant mass**

$$

F_{net} = m \frac{dv}{dt}


$$

$$

F_{net} = ma


$$

# **3.2.3 Newton's Third Law of Motion**

<Callout type="definition" title="Statement of Newton's 3rd law">
  If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert an equal and
  opposite force on body A.

These two forces form a **Action-Reaction Pair**.
