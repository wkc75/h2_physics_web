# **3.1.1 Distance vs. Displacement**

<Callout type="definition" title="Distance">
  **Distance** is the total length travelled by a moving object irrespective of
  the direction of motion.
</Callout>

<Callout type="definition" title="Displacement">
  The **displacement** of an object from a reference point O is the **linear
  distance** and **direction** of the object from O. The **linear distance**
  refers to the shortest distance from the **initial** to the **final position**
  o fan object moved from one place to another.
</Callout>

Note that distance is a **scalar** quantity whereas displacement is a **vector** quantity.

# **3.1.2 Speed vs. Velocity**

<Callout type="definition" title="Speed, v">
  The speed of an object is defined as the **rate of change of distance**
  travelled by an object with respect to **time**.

    **Average speed**, $\langle v \rangle$

    $$
    \langle v \rangle
    =
    \frac{\text{Total distance travelled}}{\text{Total time taken}}
    $$

    $$
    =
    \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
    $$

    **Instantaneous speed**, $ v = \frac{dx}{dt} $

</Callout>

<Callout type="definition" title="Velocity_, v">
  The veloicity of an object is its **rate of change of displacement** with
  respect to **time**.

    **Average veloicity**, $\langle v \rangle$

    $$
    = \frac{\text{Total change in displacement}}{\text{Total time taken}}
    $$

    $$
    = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
    $$

    **Instantaneous valocity**, $ v = \frac{ds}{dt}$

</Callout>

# **Acceleration**

<Callout type="definition" title="Acceleration, a">
The **acceleration** of an object is its **rate of change of velocity** with respect to time.

**Average acceleration**, $\langle a \rangle$

$$
\langle a \rangle
=
\frac{\text{Total change in velocity}}{\text{Total time taken}}
$$

$$
= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$

$$
= \frac{v_{final} - v_{initial}}{\Delta t}
$$

**Instantaneous acceleration**, $$ a = \frac{dv}{dt} $$

## **Sign Convention**

<Callout type="exam" title="Sign Convention">
    <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
            For an object moving in 1-D, there are only two possible directions. 
            For convenience, we define one direction as **positive** and the other **negative**.
        </li>

        <li>
            For vertivcal motion, we usually define upward direction as positive:

        </li>

        <li>
            For horizontal motion, we usually take direction to the right as positive:

## Displacement-Time Graphs ($s-t$ graph)

![s-t graph](/images/motion_and_forces/s-t_graph.png)

<Callout type="definition" title="On a s-t graph">

    The **instantaneous velocity** is the **slope**
    (or **gradient**) of the **tangent line** at a given **instant**
    of time.

</Callout>

## Velocity vs. Time Graph (v-t graph)

![v-t graph](/images/motion_and_forces/v-t_graph.png)

<Callout type="definition" title="On a v-t graph">

    The **instantaneous acceleration** is the **slope** (or **gradient**)
    of the **tangent line** at a given instant of time.

    The **area under a v-t graph** for a time interval of $\Delta t$ gives the
    **change in displacement** of the object in that time interval.

# **3.1.3 Describing 1-D Motion using Equations (for uniform acceleration)**

Below is the velocity-time graph of a object undergoing 1-D motion with a constant acceleration, $a$, a initial velocity ,$u$, and a final velocity, $v$.

<Callout type="definition" title="The acceleration is given as ">
    $$
        a = \frac{v - u}{t}

    **By rearranging, we get:**

    $$
        (1) \quad v = u + at
    $$
