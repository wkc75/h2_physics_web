# **Learning Outcomes**

You should always keep the learning outcomes in mind when preparing for your exams,  
but do not let them restrict your curiosity or deeper understanding.

        state and apply each of Newton’s laws of motion:
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
          <li>
            <strong>First law:</strong> a body at rest will stay at rest, and a body
            in motion will continue to move at constant velocity, unless acted on
            by a resultant external force.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Second law:</strong> the rate of change of momentum of a body is
            directly proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and is
            in the same direction as the resultant force.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third law:</strong> the force exerted by one body on a second body
            is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force
            simultaneously exerted by the second body on the first body.
          </li>
