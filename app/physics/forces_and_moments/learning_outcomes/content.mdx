# **Learning Outcomes**

You should always keep the learning outcomes in mind when preparing for your exams,

but do not let them restrict your curiosity or deeper understanding.

        2 Forces and Moments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>
        describe the forces on a mass, charge and current-carrying conductor in
        gravitational, electric and magnetic fields, as appropriate. (*more in respective chapters*)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>
        show a qualitative understanding of forces including normal force,
        buoyant force (upthrust), frictional force and viscous force, e.g. air
        resistance. (knowledge of the concepts of coefficients of friction and
        viscosity is not required)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>
        recall and apply Hooke’s law (F = kx, where k is the force constant) to
        new situations or to solve related problems.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>d</td>
      <td>
        define and apply the moment of a force and the torque of a couple.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>
        show an understanding that a couple is a pair of forces which tends to
        produce rotation only.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>f</td>
      <td>
        show an understanding that the weight of a body may be taken as acting
        at a single point known as its centre of gravity.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>g</td>
      <td>
        apply the principle of moments to new situations or to solve related
        problems.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>
        show an understanding that, when there is no resultant force and no
        resultant torque, a system is in equilibrium.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>
        use free-body diagrams and vector triangles to represent forces on
        bodies that are in rotational and translational equilibrium.
      </td>
