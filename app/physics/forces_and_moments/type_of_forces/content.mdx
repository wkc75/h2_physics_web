## **2.1.4 Contact Forces**

When two surfaces come into contact, they both experience contact forces exerted by each other.

Contact force can be resolved into
a component that is **perpendicular** to the surfaces, called **normal contact force** and
a component that is **parallel** to the surfaces, called **friction**.

### **Normal Contact Force**

**Normal contact force** arises from the electrostatic repulsion between
molecules of two surfaces.

In free-body diagrams, normal contact force must be perpendicular to the
surfaces and must be drawn from the contact point.

![drawing of normal contact force](/images/forces_and_moments/normal_contact_force_drawing.png)

### **Friction**

**Friction** is the force that resists relative motion between two
sliding surfaces (kinetic friction), or the tendency for relative
motion between two stationary surfaces (static friction).

Friction is always directed in the direction opposite to the
direction of **relative motion**.

![drawing of friction](/images/forces_and_moments/friction_drawing.png)

## **2.1.5 Tension**

**Tension** is the pulling force exerted by a string, rope, cable
or chain on the object tied to its end when it is pulled **taut**.

$ - $ At the end of a string, the direction of the tension force exerted on
the object is **along the string**, directed **away from the object**.

$ - $ Within the string, the magnitude of the tension is **constant**,
and the tension acts in both directions equally.

$ - $ Once the string is **slack**, the tension falls to zero.

$ - $ In many situations, we idealise the string, rope, cable, etc. to
be **massless** and **inextensible** to simplify analysis.

$ - $ In situations in which pulleys are used, we idealise a pulley
to be **massless** and **frictionless** to simplify analysis.

![tension_drawing](/images/forces_and_moments/tension_drawing.png)

## **2.1.6 Upthrust (buoyant force)**

**Upthrust** $U$ refers to the **net upward** force exerted **by a
fluid** on a body **fully or partially** submerged in the fluid.

![Upthrust](/images/forces_and_moments/upthrust_pressure_diff.png)

The fluid forces acting on the side faces of the cube are equal in
magnitude and in opposite directions, thus resulting in **zero net
horizontal force**.

The fluid force $ F_1$ acting on the **bottom** surface is $F_1 = \rho g h_1 A $

The fluid force $ F_2$ acting on the **bottom** surface is $F_2 = \rho g h_2 A $

Therefore, the **net vertial force** is

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_1 - F_2
&= \rho g h_1 A - \rho g h_2 A \\
&= (h_1 - h_2)\rho g A \\
&= \Delta h \, \rho g A \\
&= \rho V g \quad (\text{since the volume of the cube is } V = A\Delta h) \\
&= (\text{mass of fluid displaced})\, g \\
&= \text{weight of fluid displaced}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Archimedes' Principle**

For a body submerged or floating in a fluid, the upthrust acting on the body **is equal
in magnitude and opposite in direction** to the **weight of fluid displaced by the body**

$$
U = \rho V g
$$

In free-body diagrams, upthrust must be drawn from the centre of gravity of the displaced fluid.

## **2.1.7 Viscous Drag Force**

**Drag** (or viscous force) refers to forces that **opposes** the relative
motion of an object through a fluid.

Factors affecting the magnitude of drag force is

$ - $ **veloicity**
, generally, $ F = kv $ ($k$ is a constant)

$ - $ Shape

$ - $ Dimension

**Air resistance** is a type of drag force.

## **2.1.8 Hooke's law**

<InlineCitation
  label="2c"
  content="recall and apply Hooke’s law (F = kx, where k is the force constant) 
  to new situations or to solve related problems."
/>

Hooke's Law states that the **magnitude of force F exerted by
spring on a body** attached to the spring is proportional to the
**extension** $x$ of the spring from its natural length provided
the proportional limit of the spring is not exceeded

$$
F = kx
$$

$k$ is constant of proportionality
