# **Moment of a Force**

  content="define and apply the moment of a force 
           and the torque of a couple."
/>

<Callout type="definition" title="Moment">
  **The moment of a force $\tau$** about a point is the product of the
  (magnitude of the) force **F** and the perpendicular distance $r_\perp$ from
  the line of action of the force to the point.

$$
\tau = F (r_\perp)
$$

## **Couple**

<Callout type="definition" title="Couple">
  Couple is a pair of forces, which are **equal in magnitude but opposite in
  direction**, whose lines of action do not coincide.
</Callout>

Couples produce **only rotation** but no translation.

<InlineCitation
  label="2e"
  content="show an understanding that a couple is a pair of forces which 
           tends to produce rotation only."
/>

<Callout type="definition" title="Torque">
**Torque of a couple** is the product of the perpendicular
distance between the lines of action of the forces and the
magnitude of one of the forces.

$$
\tau = F x
$$
